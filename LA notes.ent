macro:->I
use
this
set
of
problems
to
emphasize
that
students
already
have
experience
with
linear
algebra
problems
and
that
we
will
be
looking
to
classify
all
possibilities
in
related
problems.
A
reviewer
for
these
notes
suggested
that
I
explain
here
what
is
meant
by
\lq
\lq
{Solve}\rq
\rq
.
I
don't
typically
explain
this
until
a
student
asks
what
I
mean
by
\lq
\lq
{Solve}\rq
\rq
.
This
both
encourages
them
to
ask
a
question
when
they
are
unsure
and
let's
us
all
have
a
brief
discussion
to
ensure
we
are
on
the
same
footing.
The
reviewer
suggested
\lq
\lq
{Find
possible
values
of
$x_1$
and
$x_2$
so
that
the
following
equations
are
both
true}\rq
\rq
.
\@endanenote 
\@doanenote {2}
macro:->This
ends
up
being
a
great
place
to
talk
about
being
careful
about
what
exactly
is
being
said.
In
student
work,
you
will
often
see
phrases
like
\lq
\lq
{matrix
is
unique}\rq
\rq
or
\lq
\lq
{matrix
is
consistent}\rq
\rq
.
This
is
a
great
time
to
talk
to
students
about
kinds
of
objects
and
the
properties
of
an
object
type.
For
instance,
a
matrix
cannot
be
consistent
but
a
system
of
equations
can
be.
A
matrix
can
be
unique
but
more
often
than
not
the
student
means
that
the
associated
system
of
equations
has
a
unique
solution.
One
of
the
great
struggles
in
these
junior
level
courses
is
getting
students
into
the
habit
of
editing
their
work
with
precision.
\par
It
is
not
uncommon
for
the
class
to
have
to
work
and
rephrase
even
their
best
attempts
at
the
consistency
and
uniqueness
theorems.
I
will
allow
them
to
change
these
theorems
later
in
the
course
if
they
see
why
they
need
to.
\par
The
next
two
questions
can
be
left
out.
The
proofs
are
rarely
completed
by
any
but
the
most
persistent
students
and
require
a
facility
with
proof
techniques
that
many
students
have
seen
but
not
internalized
yet.
Hand-waving
versions
of
the
proofs
can
be
presented
fairly
easily.
Your
mileage
may
vary.
\@endanenote 
\@doanenote {3}
macro:->This
question
usually
precipitates
a
discussion
of
what
intersection
means.
Some
students
will
say
that
you
are
considering
the
intersection
of
all
the
objects
in
a
collection
and
others
may
say
that
you
can
consider
anywhere
that
at
least
two
of
the
objects
have
in
common.
I
like
to
use
this
as
motivation
for
why
we
are
using
IBL
and
talking
about
things
\lq
\lq
{everyone
already
knows.}\rq
\rq
I
like
to
mention
how
having
seen
a
topic
is
different
than
having
made
sense
of
definition
and
examples.

mixes
some

macro:->The
point
of
this

is
do
Chapter

using

be
the
only
time
they
need
to
go
through
all
ten
of
the
parts
of
definition
of
a
vector

they
should
go
through
this

all
the
facets
that
are

macro:->This

show
how
solution
sets
to
linear

of
differential
equations
are
a
vector
space
(a
subspace
of
the
proper
set
of
functions).
Specifically,
the
differential
equation
can
be
thought
of
as
a
linear
transformation,
and
thus
the
solutions
to
homogeneous
differential
equations
can
be
found
as
the
null
space
of
the
linear

The

\@endanenote

macro:->In
the

we
use
an
elementary

This

I
take
this
as
a
time
to
remind
students
that
everything
we
have
been
doing
as
far
as
row
operations
can
be
applied
to
deal
with
column
operations.
In
this
course
we
don't
worry
about
considering
both
concepts
all
of
the
time
in
order
to
have
time
to
deeply
understand
the
relationships
involving
row
operations.
I
also
try
to
remind
them
that
everything
we
have
done
so
far
more
or
less
stems
from
row
operations
or
can
be
taken
from
an
abstract
setting
and
applied
as
solving
a
system
of
linear
equation
(with
row
operations!!!).

Additionally,
the
next
three
questions
are
not
essential
to
the
rest
of
the
material
and
can
be
omitted
for
time.
Question
\ref
{ee}
is
vital
to
several
ideas
and
proofs
in
the
next
section.
\@endanenote 
\@doanenote {19}
macro:->Throughout
this
section,
the
students
may
ask
about
solving
some
of
the
algebraic
equations
using
complex
numbers.
Only
after
Question
\ref
{q13}
are
complex
numbers
explicitly
addressed.
I
typically
take
this
as
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
students
about
the
assumptions
that
may
be
implicit
in
problems
and
that
if
they
think
real
versus
complex
would
change
the
answer
to
the
question,
then
they
should
consider
and
write
up
both
cases
(This
always
comes
up
by
Question
\ref
{q14}
at
the
latest).
Many
students
do
not
have
facility
with
solving
algebraic
problems
with
complex
numbers
and
other
students'
presentations
offer
another
time
to
expose
them
to
these
ideas.
Your
milage
may
vary.

macro:->Part
e)
of
the
previous
problem
is
important
for
students
to
work
through
since
it
sets
up
Question
\ref
{q92}.
Sometimes
Question
\ref
{q92}
can
be
done
as
an
entire
50
minute
class
since
it
encapsulates
a
lot
of

eigenspaces,

diagonalizability.
