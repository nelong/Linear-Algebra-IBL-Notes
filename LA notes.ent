macro:->I
have
included
Sage
here
because
of
its
availability
to
all.
You
can
run
a
single
cell
of
Sage
code
at
https://sagecell.sagemath.org/
or
you
can
run
an
individual
installation
of
Sage.
You
can
also
use
other
web
based
resources
like
CalcPlot3D
(https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html)
or
other
systems
like
Mathematics,
Matlab,
Geogebra,
etc.

macro:->Sample
Sage
code
that
you
may
give
to
students
would
define
A
as
the
2
by
2
matrix
with
entries
1,
2,
3,
and
4
and
the
vector
x
with
components
1
and
2,
then
computing
$A^2
x$
is
given
below:
\par
\verb
{A=matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])}
\par
\verb
{x=vector((1,2))}
\par
\verb
{A^2*x}
